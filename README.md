NLP - A parser for English text
===

The intention here is to get a way of parsing English text. I'd like to be able
to pass things I've written through this to make sure there aren't any grammar
problems, and I'd like to be able to pass text intended for a TTS engine through
here to disambiguate homographs (examples: how to pronounce "wind" or "lives" or
"read" or "tears").

I also hope to get to a point where it can learn new words without my explicitly
entering them, but that's still a ways off.
